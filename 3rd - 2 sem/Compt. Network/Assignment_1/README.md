Module "Test" is for testing purpose:
    1. Build the entire project by IDE or makefile
    2. Run 3 classes on 3 different terminals: Tester.Main, Gateway.Gateway, Tester.UDPClient
    where:
        Tester.Main:      simulate Server
        Gateway.Gateway:  simulate Gateway
        Tester.UDPClient: simulate Client
        
     You can create as many clients as you want.

For "big" project, only build and run Gateway.Gateway, dude :)
