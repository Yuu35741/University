Method access in class Processing is one among advanced invention in this project.
The problem here is that the Main thread and Processing thread both do something with the queue but different actions.
Main thread adds Datagram packet to Queue
Processing thread remove item from it
Both must avoid race condition
=> "access" methods is created to serve them all.
Main thread uses        flag 1, parameter Datagram packet, return null
Processing thread uses  flag 0, parameter null,            return Datagram packet

    - toBytes
